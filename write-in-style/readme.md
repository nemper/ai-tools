## Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo Model

This Python script is designed to prepare and run fine-tuning for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model provided by OpenAI. It is integrated into a Streamlit web application for ease of use. The script performs various tasks related to fine-tuning, including data verification, model creation, monitoring job status, and more.

### Features and Functionality:

1. **Data Verification:**
   - Allows users to upload a JSONL file containing question-answer pairs for data verification.
   - Checks the data structure to ensure it complies with the Chat completions message structure.
   - Verifies the token count to ensure it does not exceed the 4096 token limit.
   - Provides pricing and default epoch estimates based on the dataset.

2. **Create Fine-Tuned Model:**
   - Users can upload a JSONL file for creating a fine-tuned model.
   - Validates the uploaded training and validation data files.
   - Allows users to specify a suffix for the model's name.
   - Initiates the fine-tuning process using the specified data and model.

3. **List Fine-Tuning Jobs:**
   - Displays a list of up to 10 fine-tuning jobs.

4. **Retrieve Fine-Tuning Job State:**
   - Allows users to retrieve the state of a specific fine-tuning job using its ID.

5. **Cancel Fine-Tuning Job:**
   - Provides an option to cancel a fine-tuning job by specifying its ID.

6. **List Events from Fine-Tuning Job:**
   - Lists up to 50 events from a specific fine-tuning job.

7. **Delete Fine-Tuned Model:**
   - Allows users to delete a fine-tuned model using its ID (requires ownership privileges).

8. **List Available Models:**
   - Lists available models for reference.

### How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key by defining it as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. Install the required dependencies specified in the code.
4. Run the script, and it will launch a Streamlit web application.
5. Follow the Streamlit interface to perform various fine-tuning tasks.

Make sure to replace `mojafunkcija`, `positive_login`, and other placeholders with relevant functions or libraries according to your project's structure.
