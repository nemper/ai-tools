# Text Summarization Tool

This code is designed for summarizing text documents efficiently. It utilizes various libraries and APIs to extract key information from large texts and generate concise summaries.

## Overview

The primary purpose of this code is to assist users in summarizing lengthy text documents, including PDFs, DOCX files, and plain text. It employs a combination of text processing techniques and utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for content summarization.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features and functionalities offered by this code:

- **Text Summarization**: Users can upload text documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT), and the code will automatically summarize their content, providing a condensed version of the original text.

- **Customization**: Users can customize the summarization process by specifying prompts for both the initial and final summaries, allowing for fine-tuning the summarization output.

- **Language Support**: The code supports multiple languages, and users can choose the language for transcribing audio files.

- **Feedback and Evaluation**: Users can provide feedback and evaluate the summarization results, helping to improve the summarization quality over time.

## Getting Started

To use this code for text summarization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required environment variables set up for LangSmith, including the project, tracing, and endpoint settings.

2. Clone or download the code to your local machine.

3. Customize the summarization prompts by editing the "prompt_summarizer.txt" and "prompt_pam.txt" files to match your specific requirements.

4. Run the code using Streamlit to initiate the summarization process.

5. Upload the text document you want to summarize, select the language (if transcribing audio), and customize the summarization prompts.

6. Review and download the generated summary in various formats, including TXT, PDF, and DOCX.
